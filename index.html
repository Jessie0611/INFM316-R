    The global healthcare community continues to grapple with the multifaceted challenges
    presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This virus was caused by the severe acute
    respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As knowledge about the virus expands, it's
    becoming evident that COVID-19 doesn't just affect people during the acute phase of illness.
    Emerging data suggests that some individuals experience ongoing symptoms and long-term
    complications after recovering from the initial infection, leading to what is now recognized as
    post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

<h3>Week 3:</h3>
<a href="PDF/GGPlot2.pdf" target="_blank">GG Plot </a> <br>
GGPlot 2 library used <br> <br>
<b>Data Manipulations Using R</b> 
<ul>
    <li>Imported data from an Excel file named Covid_Depression_Case_Study.xlsx.</li>
    <li>Calculated female counts from female percentage and sample size.</li>
    <li>Rounded female counts to the nearest integer.</li>
    <li>Derived male counts by subtracting female counts from sample size.</li>
    <li>Renamed the fourth column to "Sample_Size" for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Data Visualization:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Created a scatter plot using ggplot2 library.</li>
    <li>Plotted female and male counts against the "Study" variable.</li>
    <li>Customized colors for females (dark red) and males (steel blue).</li>
    <li>Adjusted point sizes.</li>
</ul>
<b>Interpretation of Scatterplot Output:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Scatterplot shows distribution of females and males across different studies.</li>
    <li>Consistent patterns or trends may suggest a relationship between the study and gender distribution.</li>
    <li>Outliers or unusual patterns can be identified.</li>
    <li>Relative proportions of genders across studies are comparable.</li>
    <li>Insights gained can aid in further analysis or decision-making regarding the studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 4:</h3>
